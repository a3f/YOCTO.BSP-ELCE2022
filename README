This project was hacked on the premises of the Embedded Linux Conference 2022
as an example on how to integrate board support for an i.MX8M-based board into
a new Yocto BSP using upstream components as opposed to vendor patches.

It's hoped it serves as a useful starting point. There's still some work
to do for everything to work completely out of the box, so pull requests
are more than welcome. :)
